# Introduction to Egregore

**Putting the "Engineering" in Context Engineering**

Egregore is an AI agent framework that revolutionizes how developers work with LLM context windows. Built on the PACT (Positioned Adaptive Context Tree) architecture, Egregore treats context like a DOM, enabling precise manipulation and control.

## The Problem

When OpenAI released ChatGPT and its API, they introduced the current primitives for context manipulation: the simple user/system/assistant chat log system. As developers built more sophisticated agents, they discovered this append-only structure has critical limitations:

### Real-World Example

Consider a typical CLI tool workflow:

1. LLM reads file A (100 lines)
2. LLM edits file A (now 112 lines)
3. LLM does something else
4. LLM tries to edit file A again → **fails** (doesn't know current structure)
5. LLM re-reads the entire file
6. LLM successfully updates the file

This repetitive execution wastes tokens, pollutes the context window, and makes unnecessary API calls. **There had to be a better way.**

## The Solution: PACT Architecture

Egregore treats the context window like a **virtual DOM**. Instead of an append-only chat log, you get:

- **Precise positioning** - Address any component with coordinates like `(0,1,0,-2,1)`
- **Dynamic manipulation** - Insert, update, delete components anywhere
- **Temporal management** - Components can expire after N turns or cycle periodically
- **Stateful views** - LLMs maintain awareness of current state without re-reading

<Tip>
Think of it like HTML/CSS for your context window. You can query, position, and manipulate components with the same precision you'd use for DOM elements.

## Key Features

### 🎯 PACT v0.1 Compliance
Full specification compliance with automatic serialization. Context components inherit from `PACTNode` with canonical fields for universal addressability.

### 🔄 Component Lifecycle System
Four component types with TTL (Time To Live) and cadence:
- **Permanent** - Never expire (default)
- **Temporary** - Expire after N turns
- **Sticky** - Expire and reappear at same position
- **Cyclic** - Expire and reappear on intervals

### 🏗️ Context Scaffolds
Persistent agent memory and capabilities. Scaffolds auto-generate tools from methods using the `@operation` decorator and communicate through a formal IPC system.

### 🪝 Comprehensive Hook System
Decorator-based lifecycle hooks for:
- Tool execution (pre_call, post_call, on_error)
- Context operations (before_change, after_change)
- Streaming (on_chunk)
- Messages (on_user_msg, on_provider_msg)
- Scaffolds (on_state_change)

### 🔌 Universal Provider Interface
30+ AI providers with standardized API:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq, and more
- Universal token counting
- OAuth interceptors for premium models
- 3-tier parameter processing

### 🌊 Workflow System
Node-based execution with:
- Native agent discovery
- Parallel processing
- Decision nodes
- Type checking and validation
- Dictionary-based result aggregation

### 📊 Telemetry & Analytics
Built-in observability:
- Context snapshots
- Component change tracking
- Tool execution monitoring
- JSONL export for analysis

## The Egregore Advantage

1. **More Steerable LLMs** - Precise control over what the model sees and when
2. **Token Efficiency** - No redundant re-reading of content
3. **Context Hygiene** - Expire unnecessary components automatically
4. **Stateful Views** - Maintain "viewports" for dynamic data
5. **Reactive Updates** - Scaffolds automatically re-render on context changes
